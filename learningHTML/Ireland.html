        <ul>
            <li>It is <strong>extremely</strong> beautiful</li>
            <li>The people are so kind and nice</li>
            <li>There are a <strong>ton</strong> of castles to look at</li>
            <li>They have the best hamburger place (I forgot what it's called)</li>
            <li>It's a romantic location...<em>Way more so than France</em> (ew gross)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p id="my trip">My first trip to Ireland was probably one of my favorite places to go. Granted, the food wasn't the best, but food in Europe will never be as good as in the US. Everything else definitely was amazing. One of my favorite locations was the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Stuart doesn't believe it exists, so I will need to take him there someday to show him.
        </p>
        
        <p id="next trip"> If I were to go back again, I would definitely visit more of Northern Ireland. I'd like to hike the entire Giant's Causeway this time (with Stuart) and also visit the western coast.
